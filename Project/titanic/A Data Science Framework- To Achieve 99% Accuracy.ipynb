    "\n",
    "It's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds."

    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Problem**: If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intellidence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?. As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. `Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology*`Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gather the Data**: John Naisbitt wrote in his book, we are 'drowning in data', yet staving for knowledge. So, chances are, the datasets already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructered, static or streamed, objective or subjective. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming 'dirty data' to 'clean data'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prepare Data for Consumption**: This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn 'wild' data into 'manageable' data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control,. data extraction, and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis**: Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (qualitative and quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model/\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Data**: Like descriptive and inferential stats, data modeling can either suummarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magiccal wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft that select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modeling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and wrong conclusion (that;s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Validate and Implement Data Model**: After you've trained your model based on subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step, we determine if our model overfit generalize, or underfit our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Optimize and Strategize**: This is the 'bionic man' step, where you iterate back through the process to make it bettter, stronger and faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your 'currency exchange' rate. \n"

    "Project Summary: The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",

    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",

    "1. **Correcting**: Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs. In addition, we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. However, since they are reasonable values, we will wait until after we complete our EDA to determine if we should include or exclude the dataset. It should be noted, that if they were unreasonable values, for example age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe decision to fix now. However, we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value, because it may be neccesary to create an  accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Completing**: There are null values or missing data in the age, cabin, and emabrked field. Missing values can be bad, because some algorithms don't know how to handle null values and will fail. While others, like decision trees, can handle null values. Thus, it's important to fix before we start modeling, because we will compare and contrast several models. There are two common methods, either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete the record, especially a large percentage of records, unless it tryly represents an incomplete record. Instead, it's best to impute missing values. A basic methodolodogy for qualitative data is impute using mode. A basic methodolody for quantitative dât is impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use the basic methodology based on specific criteria; like the average age by class or embark port by fare and SES. There are more comple methodologies, however before deploying, it shouyld be compared to the base model to determine if complexity tryly adds value. For this dataset, age will be imputed with the median, the cabin attribute will be dropped, and embark will be imputed with mode. Subsequrnt model iterations may modify this decision to determine if it improves the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating**: Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. For this dataset, we will create a title feature to determine if it improves the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Converting**: Last, but certainly not least, we'll deal with formating. There are no date or currency formats, but datatype formats. Our categorical data imported as objects, which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations. For this dataset, we will convert object datatypes to categorical dummy variables.\n"

This is important, so we don't overfit our model. Meaning, the algorithm is so specific to a given subset, it cannot accurately generalize another subset, from the same dataset. It's important our algorithm has not seen the subset we will use to test, so it doesn't \"cheat\" by memorizing the answers. We will use sklearn's train_test_split function. In later sections we will also use sklearn's cross validation functions, that splits our dataset into train and test for data modeling comparison."
